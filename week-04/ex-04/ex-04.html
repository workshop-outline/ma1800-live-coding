      With the shocking launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957, the Moon changed from 
      a distant silver disk in the sky to a real place, a probable destination for 
      probes and people. The Soviets struck first, flying Luna 1 by the Moon in January 
      1959. They followed this success with a number of other robotic probes, culminating 
      later the same year with Luna 3, which photographed the far side of the Moon, never 
      visible from Earth. From these early, poor quality images, we discovered that the far 
      side has surprisingly little of the dark, smooth mare plains that cover about a third 
      of the near side. Other surprises would soon follow.

      In response to the 1961 flight of Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, President John F. Kennedy 
      committed the United States to landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. The Apollo 
      program greatly accelerated interest in exploring the Moon. To ensure that human crews could 
      safely land and depart from the lunar surface, it was important to understand its environment, 
      surface and processes. At the same time, the robotic precursors would collect valuable 
      information, constituting the first scientific exploration of another planetary body.
