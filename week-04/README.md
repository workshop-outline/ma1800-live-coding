# Week 4 — Layout and Image Gallery

This week focuses on structuring pages and creating image galleries. You’ll use CSS layout techniques and start working with multiple elements.

## Exercises
- **ex-01 Basic Page Layout with Divs**  
  Create header, main content, and footer.

- **ex-02 Multi-Column Layout**  
  Use `flexbox` to make side-by-side columns.

- **ex-03 Image Gallery (Grid)**  
  Display images in a grid layout.

- **ex-04 Styling the Gallery**  
  Add borders, spacing, and hover effects.

## Tips
- Flexbox is your friend — it’s easier than floats.  
- Keep images in the `assets/` folder.  
- Experiment with different numbers of columns to see how layout changes.
