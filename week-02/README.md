# Week 2 — Net.Art and Hypertext

This week explores **hypertext** — linking between pages — and connects this to early net.art practices.

## Exercises
- **ex-01 Hyperlinks**  
  Use `<a href="...">Link</a>` to connect pages.

- **ex-02 Hypertext Navigation**  
  Create internal page jumps with `<a href="#section1">`.

- **ex-03 Lots of Tags**  
  Experiment with different HTML tags and mix them creatively.

- **ex-04 Images**  
  Add images with `<img>` and link them to other pages.

## Tips
- Check all your links carefully.  
- Try building a small narrative by linking multiple pages together.  
- Remember: hypertext can be playful, not just functional.
