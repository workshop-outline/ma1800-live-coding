# Week 1 — HTML Basics

This week introduces the core building blocks of HTML. You’ll learn how to structure a webpage, add text, and start thinking about how content is organised.

## Exercises
- **ex-01 Hello World**  
  Your first HTML page. Practice writing `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.

- **ex-02 Headings and Paragraphs**  
  Learn `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings and `<p>` for paragraphs.

- **ex-03 File Structure and Images**  
  Insert an image using `<img src="assets/example.png" alt="description">`. Understand where files live.

- **ex-04 Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules**  
  Use `<br>` for line breaks and `<hr>` to divide sections.

## Tips
- Always close your tags (e.g. `</p>`).  
- Keep filenames simple (no spaces).  
- The `assets/` folder is empty for now — later weeks will use it for images and other files.
