# Week 3 — Introduction to CSS

This week introduces CSS for styling your pages. You’ll connect a stylesheet and experiment with colours, fonts, and layout basics.

## Exercises
- **ex-01 Linking CSS, Colours, and Fonts**  
  Attach a stylesheet with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`.

- **ex-02 Using Div**  
  Use `<div>` to group content.

- **ex-03 Classes and IDs**  
  Target elements with `.class` and `#id`.

- **ex-04 Hover Effects**  
  Use `:hover` to change styles when the mouse moves over an element.

- **ex-05 Background Image Repeat**  
  Apply repeating images with `background-image` and `background-repeat`.

## Tips
- Keep HTML and CSS in separate files for clarity.  
- Use comments (`/* ... */`) in CSS to organise your code.  
- Test hover effects in the browser as you code.
